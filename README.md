# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This week‚Äôs challenge was to add functionality to a work day scheduler using jquery along with dayjs. 

In the beginning of the project I struggled getting started. Though there were some helpful comments in the script file, I didn‚Äôt know where to start. I decided on setting up the dayjs time first since the main functionality of the app was to use time which  adds and removes classes off a specific div.

Several classmates and I tried to break down different aspects of the challenge, but it ended up raising more questions than answers. Luckily this session made it easier to come up with specific questions to ask my tutor, who provided me with immense help in getting the project somewhat functional.

Most of the criteria is there, besides the color class changing functionality which I unfortunately did not complete.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
